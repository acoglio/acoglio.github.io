<h2>General</h2>

<p>I work in computer science, primarily formal methods and their application to a variety of domains.
My activities range from theoretical research to code development.</p>

<p>I'm on
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-coglio">LinkedIn</a>,
<a href="https://www.github.com/acoglio">GitHub</a>,
and no (other) social network.</p>

<h2>Schools</h2>

<p>I have a laurea degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://unige.it//">University of Genoa</a>.
My thesis was on theorem proving, in collaboration with
<a href="https://www.fbk.eu/">ITC-IRST (now FBK)</a> (Trento, Italy) and
<a href="https://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>.</p>

<p>I'm a <a href="https://apm.stanford.edu">Stanford Certified Project Manager</a>.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>I'm using <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</a> at both Kestrel and Provable.

The one for Java contains an
<a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/tree/master/books/kestrel/java/aij/java">interpreter of (executable) ACL2 written in Java</a>.</p>

<p>I'm contributing to Aleo/Provable's Rust implementations of
<a href="https://github.com/ProvableHQ/leo">Leo</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/AleoNet/snarkVM">snarkVM</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/AleoNet/snarkOS">snarkOS</a>.</p>

<p>At Kestrel, I've used <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de">Isabelle/HOL</a>,
also making some contributions to the <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/index.html">Isabelle/HOL library</a>
and to the <a href="https://www.isa-afp.org">Archive of Formal Proofs</a> [<a href="#afp-2014">18</a>].
I wrote an Isabelle/HOL formalization of the multi-domain multi-level security labels described in
[<a href="#aerospace-2012">20</a>,
 <a href="#software-2014">19</a>,
 <a href="#smcit-2014">17</a>],
and implemented a C library of operations on these labels.</p>

<p>At Kestrel, I've used <a href="https://pvs.csl.sri.com">PVS</a>,
in particular to formalize parts of a virtual Trusted Platform Module.</p>

<p>I wrote some of the libraries in Kestrel's <a href="https://github.com/KestrelInstitute/Specware/">Specware</a>.
I used Specware to formalize portions of
C, Java, the Java Virtual Machine, the Java Card Runtime Environment, Tokeneer (a system guarding a secure enclave),
and other artifacts.</p>

<p>At Kestrel, I co-developed a Java Card Runtime Environment in C, runnable on a commercial smart card chip.</a>

<p>At University of Genoa, I wrote a C++ implementation of
an executor of high-level Petri nets, formally specified in [<a href="#techrep-1997-executor">43</a>],
for an industrial application.</p>

<p>During middle and high school, I developed some video games in assembly on the Commodore 64 and on the Commodore Amiga.
During university, I developed a graphical generator of hypertextual adventure games in HyperCard's clone Plus.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>I contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper">Ethereum Yellow Paper</a>.
I was a member of the Ethereum Yellow Paper Maintainers Team and the Ethereum Specification Maintainers Team.</p>

<o>I was a member of the Expert Group for
<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=202">Java Specification Request 202 (Java Class File Specification Update)</a>.</p>

<p>My research analysis of Java bytecode verification contributed to improving its specification,
as acknowledged in the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-0-preface7.html">Preface to the Java SE 7 Edition
of the JVM Specification</a>.

<p>I peer-review papers for conferences and journals.</p>

<p>I was Program Co-Chair of the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2023/index.html">ACL2-2023 Workshop</a>.</p>

{Short summary of my thesis work:
formalism to specify control strategies of theorem provers by enriching logical inference rules with control annotations
and by using tactics and tacticals to construct proofs with the annotated rules;
specification of a substantial portion of the NQTHM theorem prover using the formalism.
Elaborations of a significant subcase of this formalism are defined in [<a href="#calculemus-1999">38</a>, <a href="#frocos-2000">37</a>, <a href="#jsc-2001">32</a>];
a formalism to specify logics of theorem provers, on which this formalism is based, is described in [<a href="#techrep-1997-nqthm">50</a>];
overviews of the project within which this work was performed are in [<a href="#ids-1998">42</a>, <a href="#wrla-1998">41</a>].}</li>
